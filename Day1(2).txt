Question2: What is code environment? and Types?
Answer: Code environment is where a programmer writes code and executes it.Each code environment has its own set of packages.
        Environments are independent: you can install different packages or different versions of packages in different environments without interaction between them.
        Types:
        1.Local Environment - this will be the environment that is included with your operating system.
        2.Virtual Environment - This Goes one step further than the local environment by installing a piece of software on 
                                the local environment to be able to virtualize instances of a machine onto the local machine.
        3.Cloud Environment - This goes even further than the virtual environment, by completely eliminating the hardware and 
                              just provides you access to the machine over an SSH or internet connection in order for you to configure your specific environment.
